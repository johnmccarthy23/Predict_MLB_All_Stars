# Predict_MLB_All_Stars
A project I worked on during my time in the Summer STEM Institute in 2020. I used Logistic Regression to predict future MLB All-Stars from major league performance from years before a player's first all-star selection. I wanted to elevate the standard of data analytics in baseball and help teams make better informed decisions.
